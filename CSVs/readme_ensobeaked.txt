Attached are the r files and csvs used to get up to this point in the project. A quick summary of each r project:

Sightings
1. sighting_rates_mei_gh.R: Calculating and analyzing sighting rates for beaked whale species in relation to enso values
2. sightings_graph_gh.R: Graphing sightings location and effort lines by MEI

Tags
1. Adding_mei_pdo_values_tags_gh.R: Adding mei and pdo values to beaked whale tags
2. tag_displacement_gh.R: Calculating displacement between tag points for beaked whale data
3. Variable_plots_tags_gh.R: Performing exploratory research with beaked whale tag and enso data

CSVs (if any are missing from the r projects, please let me know):
1. Allsightings_biasremoved_monthsbelow40hrHIadjusted_beaked: All beaked whale sightings, but months at HI with less 
than 40 hours of effort have been combined if possible. Points with bias have also been removed. 
2. coastline files: coastline shapefiles for plotting
3. Effort_thruNov2022_GIS_2023MAY_Enso_comb_beaked: Effort file with months at HI similarly combined as mentioned above
4. hawaii_effort_beakedwhale_sightings_MEI_values_v1_MAY23: excel workbook with sheets of information and r data
5. MdTags_4hr_use_seafloor_geomorph_oceangographic_var_enso_MAY23_v1: Blainville's tags with all enso columns, 
oceanographic variables, etc. 
6. mei_values_csv: mei values by month and year
7. pdo_period.csv: pdo period by month and year
8. pdo_value_monthly: pdo value by month and year
9. ZcTags_4hr_use_seafloor_geomorph_oceangographic_enso_300m_var_MAY23_v1: Cuvier's tags with all enso columns, 
oceanographic variables, etc.
